DueUIConfig({
	/*
	 * Some terminology...
	 * 
	 * This file is organized as a tree of "elements".  Not to be confused
	 * with HTML elements, a DueUI element is either a container such as a
	 * "panel" or a "widget" such as a "button".  All emements have a "type"
	 * attribute that decide their purpose.  They also _should_ have an "id"
	 * attribute that makes them unique and create a handle that they can be
	 * referenced with in other parts of the config file.  It's OK to omit
	 * the "id" if you won't need to reference the element elsewhere but
	 * I've included them in all elements in this file for completeness
	 * and clarity.  Each element can also have an optional "enabled"
	 * attribute which controls if the element will actually be created.
	 * It's default is "true" so if you don't include it, the element
	 * will be shown by default.  Set it to "false" if you temporarily
	 * need to exclude an element for testing purposes.   
	 * 
	 * Another common element attribute is "style" which can contain any CSS
	 * styles you want set for the object.  If you see something you don't
	 * understand in a style, check https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp.
	 * 
	 * Element types:
	 * 
	 * Panels:
	 * There are 3 types of panel elements...
	 * 
	 * "panel": A simple container with no special behavior.
	 * 
	 * "tabbed_panel": An extension of panel that has separate areas
	 * for specific purposes.  
	 * 	* A "header_panel" which is just a plain panel at the top of
	 *		the screen that stays visible at all times.
	 *  * A "menubar" panel locked to the bottom of the screen that
	 *    contains buttons allowing you to switch between tabs.
	 *  * "tab_panel"s that resize dynamically between the
	 *    header and menubar and contain the bulk of the content
	 * 
	 * "tab_panel": A plain panel that adds a button to it's tabbed_panel
	 * parent's menubar and is only shown when the menubar button is clicked.
	 * These should only be direct children of a tabbed_panel.
	 * 
	 * Widgets:
	 * There are many types of widget elements.
	 * 
	 * Some like "button" and "textarea" are "primitive" widgets.  The term
	 * "primitive" in this context refers to the fact that these widgets
	 * aren't composed of other widgets and could possibly be components
	 * of other widgets.
	 * 
	 * Other widgets like "heater_labels" are "convenience" widgets.
	 * This one is a plain panel containing 4 static buttons displaying heater
	 * field labels.
	 * 
	 * Speaking of which, "heater" is an example of a complex
	 * widget that consists of a panel containing 2 buttons and 2 input fields
	 * plus logic to change the colors of the buttons, turn the heater
	 * on or off, set the temps, etc.
	 *
